# E-nose Data Analysis [![Tests](https://github.com/aungkhantmaw64/enose-data-analysis/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aungkhantmaw64/enose-data-analysis/actions)
## Introduction
This repository contains analytics for the experimental ordor dataset I created using the hybrid-electronic nose designed as an aiding device for non-invasive diaganosis. I published an IEEE research [article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9495905) as a main author based on this device and the code used for the analytics of the dataset can be found in this repo
